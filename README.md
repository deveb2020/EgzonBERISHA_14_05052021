_Convert old jQuery code to new React code and optimise the loading speed in the browser_

## Project key informations

* The main objective of this project was to learn how to convert old code into new code.

* In this project I am using Code Splitting method and React Lazy component to optimize browser loading speed.

* Basically what I did is split the bundle into several pieces and thanks to the React lazy component, I download only the desired file and not the whole bundle/project

* I use Redux with hooks for the state menagement

* I use Lighthouse to compare the performances of the two versions
